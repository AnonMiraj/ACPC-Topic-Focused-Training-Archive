Welcome to the **ACPC-Topic-Focused-Training-Archive** repository! Created by the **ACPC Scientific Committee**, this project provides a collaborative space for contributors to share solutions to problems from the **Arab Collegiate Programming Contest (ACPC)** region. We encourage everyone to participate and improve their problem-solving skills through teamwork and knowledge sharing.


## How to Contribute

Ensure your code includes comments explaining the steps of your solution. If possible, also include a brief description in the solution file detailing how you approached and solved the problem (e.g., `bfs-solution.cpp`).


We welcome contributions from everyone! To contribute:

1. **Fork** the repository.
2. **Clone** your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MoamenAhmedMostafa/ACPC-Topic-Focused-Training-Archive.git
   ```
3. Add your solution inside the appropriate folder. Please follow the directory structure:
   ```
   /ACPC-Topic-Focused-Training-Archive
      /Topic
         /Problem
           /solution_file
   ```
   Example:
   ```
   /ACPC-Topic-Focused-Training-Archive
      /number theory (easy)
         /a
            /prime_fact_sol.py
   ```
* Even if the contest name on Codeforces is ``topic(diff)``, please ensure that the folder name is ``topic (diff)``. For example, ``graph(easy)`` is an incorrect folder name, even though it is the contest name on Codeforces. The correct folder name should be ``graph (easy)``.

4. **Commit** and **push** your changes to your fork:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Added solution for problem X in language Y"
   git push origin
   ```
6. Submit a **pull request** with a clear description of the solution you are submitting.

## Code of Conduct

Please be respectful and help maintain a positive and inclusive environment for everyone.
